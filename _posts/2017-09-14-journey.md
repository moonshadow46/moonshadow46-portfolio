title: My Journey toward Web Developer
---
I start learning how to build website because I want to build a career instead of just working jobs. As my experience, jobs are usually dead end if there is no specialized skills, which is exactly what I am lacking of.

Why did I choose web developing instead of other computer related profession? At first it was just a religious practice, I simply tried out the opportunity presented to me. I got an Email invite to attend the introduction session of Web Development (HTML and CSS), so I went. I sat through the quick intro, and I liked it. After the session, do a bit more research at home regarding the career as web developer, like the odd as career advance, so web developing it is. Next step is to choose an institution which offer online boot-camp type of course, and a friend recommanded Bloc Team for me. Therefore, I stepped into web developing world.

So far, I had gone through developing website by HTML/CSS/JavaScript, implementing library (jQuery), and with Framework (angular). Although I still like the most basic way, but it is always a good thing to know different ways.
