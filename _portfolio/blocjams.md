short-description: Making Bloc Jams in different ways is interesting!

---
<h2>Summary</h2>
As the web development learner, it is a great practice to construct the same website with different methods.
<h2>Explanation</h2>
The Bloc Jams is a music streaming website which the Web Development Track students of Bloc go through as an exercise of how to develop a website through different methods. So far, we went through 3 different ways of developing a website:
* Basic: The very basic way of developing a website without library or framework.</li>
* With Library: In my case, jQuery is utilized.</li>
* With Framework: In my case, angular.js is utilized along with some jQuery.</li>
<h2>Problems</h2>
The sole reason I am on Bloc Jams projects is to experience through all 3 different ways to develop the website. First, using the traditional way to develop a website, and developing everything from scratch. Then refactor the completed website by implementing library (jQuery). And finally, using framework (angular), along with a little library, and recreate the website with templates and controllers.

There were not that much of the problems involving with the website creating. Most of the problems that I ran into were on unclear instruction and typos within the codes. The remaining part of the problems was that I have the path to end result, but I do not have the right codes to complete the tasks.
<h2>Solution</h2>
To all the problems that I ran into, debugging/typos and figuring out the right path, I utilized the one or more of the following methods to generate the solution:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Problem Types</th>
    <th>Solution</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Debug/Typos</td>
    <td>While knowing the end results should be, I use the "inspect" option to see which line of coding is faulty, then review the faulty part of the code. Definitely read through every line in extreme detail as many times, they were just upper/lower case typos and make sure all syntax/variable matches.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Unclear Instruction</td>
    <td>To solve this, just go back to the checkpoint instruction and read it again to see if I missed something. Then check with my mentor to clarify.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not knowing the right codes</td>
    <td>This one can be tricky and frustrating sometimes. To solve this, I would try the reverse engineer from the end results that I need to achieve, then workout the logic/functions toward the beginning. When stuck in between, either google for ideas, or talk to others (mostly my mentor), then either others suggest or point out the path for me, or the path just show up when talking through the process.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>Results</h2>
The results came from the solutions mentioned above really help fixing different problems. In the end, the website is functioning as it supposes to be.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
All three methods work just fine, it is just how the developer prefer when constructing the project. Each method has its pros and cons. By practice with all three, it will help the Web Development new learners choosing how they want to build the site.
